# NaNo's Game Systems Collection

**Author:** speoplee / Santiago, Chile

## Overview

This repository includes several gameplay systems developed for Roblox. Most of the systems are modular, aiming for complexity while remaining readable and maintainable.  

Modular architecture is used in all modules of the **Gun System**, **Door System**, and **Inventory**. Optimization and code reuse have been applied in multiple scripts across the repository.  

You can find videos of each system in action on my personal portfolio website.  

The systems included are:  

- **NaNo's Gun Engine:** A weapons engine focused on providing the most realistic experience possible, although still under development. Some modules, like `BulletHandler` and the raycasting system, are not included.  

- **Inventory:** A modular inventory system that supports multi-slot items and allows them to be moved. It is a functional prototype.  

- **Lockpicking:** A simple, intuitive minigame for opening doors.  

- **Pathfinding:** A 3D A* implementation (based on the Geek for Geeks version of A*).  

Most of these systems are functional prototypes.
